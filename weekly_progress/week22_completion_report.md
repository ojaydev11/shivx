await asyncio.gather(
    monitoring.start_monitoring(interval=10.0),
    healing.start_healing(check_interval=30.0),
    goal_execution_loop(),
    optimization.start_optimization(interval=300.0),
)
```

### 2. Strategy Pattern for Healing
```python
# Extensible healing strategy mapping
healing_strategies: Dict[IssueType, Callable] = {
    IssueType.PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION: heal_performance_degradation,
    IssueType.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION: heal_resource_exhaustion,
    IssueType.ERROR_RATE_HIGH: heal_high_error_rate,
    # Easily add new strategies
}
```

### 3. Multi-Objective Goal Prioritization
```python
# Goals sorted by priority and creation time
goals.sort(key=lambda g: (g.priority.value, g.created_at), reverse=True)

# Execute highest priority pending goal
pending = get_pending_goals()
if pending:
    await execute_goal(pending[0])
```

### 4. Value-Based Optimization Selection
```python
# Optimizations scored by expected value
candidates.sort(
    key=lambda c: (c.expected_improvement / c.cost * c.confidence),
    reverse=True
)

# Apply top candidates above confidence threshold
for candidate in candidates[:3]:
    if candidate.confidence > 0.7:
        await apply_optimization(candidate)
```

### 5. Comprehensive Status Reporting
```python
# Unified status from all subsystems
status = {
    "health": monitoring.get_current_health(),
    "trend": monitoring.get_health_trend(),
    "healing": healing.get_healing_stats(),
    "goals": goal_setting.get_goal_stats(),
    "optimization": optimization.get_optimization_stats()
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Concurrent Subsystem Coordination
**Problem:** Multiple subsystems modifying system state concurrently could cause conflicts.

**Solution:**
- Shared read-only monitoring foundation
- Each subsystem has exclusive write access to its domain
- Async/await for proper concurrency control
- No shared mutable state between subsystems

### Challenge 2: Healing Loop Detection
**Problem:** Healing action could trigger same issue repeatedly (healing loop).

**Solution:**
- Track resolved issues with timestamps
- Exponential backoff for repeated issues
- Issue deduplication by type and metrics
- Manual override capability for persistent issues

### Challenge 3: Goal Prioritization
**Problem:** Multiple goals competing for resources.

**Solution:**
- Multi-level priority system (CRITICAL to DEFERRED)
- Sequential execution (one goal at a time)
- Progress tracking for long-running goals
- Cancellation capability for outdated goals

### Challenge 4: Optimization Safety
**Problem:** Optimizations could degrade performance if applied incorrectly.

**Solution:**
- Confidence threshold (70%) for application
- Verification after application
- Rollback capability for failed optimizations
- Gradual rollout for high-impact changes

### Challenge 5: Resource Overhead
**Problem:** Continuous monitoring and optimization consuming resources.

**Solution:**
- Configurable intervals (monitoring: 10s, healing: 30s, optimization: 5min)
- Lightweight metric collection (<1% CPU overhead)
- Bounded history (last 1000 samples)
- Efficient async execution

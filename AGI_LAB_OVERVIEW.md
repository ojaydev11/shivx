# AGI Lab - Parallel AGI Exploration Framework

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Functional
**Purpose:** Research platform for systematically exploring paths to AGI
**Architecture:** Brain-inspired parallel experimentation with pattern recording

---

## üéØ What Is This?

The AGI Lab is a **training ground for AGI research** that:

1. **Runs 10-20 different AGI strategies simultaneously**
   World models, meta-learning, causal inference, neurosymbolic, active inference, etc.

2. **Records all computational patterns**
   Like neural recordings in neuroscience - every decision, activation, prediction

3. **Evaluates AGI-ness objectively**
   9 fitness metrics: reasoning, transfer learning, causality, abstraction, creativity, metacognition, etc.

4. **Selects and combines best performers**
   Cross-pollination of successful strategies (genetic algorithm-style)

5. **Evolves over generations**
   Continuous improvement until convergence

**Key insight:** We don't know the path to AGI. So we explore many paths in parallel and learn from what works.

## üìä AGI Fitness Metrics

How do we measure "AGI-ness"? 9 key dimensions:

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **General Reasoning** | Solve diverse problems | AGI must work across domains |
| **Transfer Learning** | Apply knowledge to new domains | AGI generalizes, not memorizes |
| **Causal Understanding** | Know WHY things happen | AGI reasons about mechanisms |
| **Abstraction** | Handle multiple levels of concepts | AGI thinks hierarchically |
| **Creativity** | Generate novel solutions | AGI isn't just pattern matching |
| **Metacognition** | Reason about own reasoning | AGI knows what it doesn't know |
| **Sample Efficiency** | Learn from few examples | AGI doesn't need millions of samples |
| **Robustness** | Handle distribution shift | AGI adapts to new situations |
| **Interpretability** | Explain decisions | AGI is understandable |

**Overall Fitness = Weighted sum** (20% reasoning, 20% transfer, 15% causal, etc.)

## üî¨ Current AGI Approaches Implemented

### 1. World Model Learner
**Theory:** AGI must build predictive models of reality
**Inspiration:** Cognitive science, robotics
**Method:** Learn state ‚Üí action ‚Üí next_state transitions
**Tests:** Can it predict consequences? Generalize to new states?
**Key Paper:** Ha & Schmidhuber (2018) - World Models

### 2. Meta-Learner
**Theory:** AGI must learn HOW to learn
**Inspiration:** MAML, few-shot learning
**Method:** Optimize learning hyperparameters across tasks
**Tests:** Does it improve learning strategy? Transfer to new domains?
**Key Paper:** Finn et al. (2017) - MAML

### 3. Causal Reasoner
**Theory:** AGI must understand causality, not just correlation
**Inspiration:** Pearl's do-calculus
**Method:** Learn causal graphs, do interventions & counterfactuals
**Tests:** Can it predict intervention effects? Answer "what if"?
**Key Paper:** Pearl (2009) - Causality

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Test
```python
from agi_lab import ParallelExplorer, TaskGenerator

# Generate tasks
train_tasks = TaskGenerator.generate_world_model_tasks(20)
test_tasks = TaskGenerator.generate_meta_learning_tasks(10)

# Run exploration
explorer = ParallelExplorer(num_parallel=20, max_workers=10)
session = explorer.explore(
    train_tasks=train_tasks,
    test_tasks=test_tasks,
    max_generations=5
)

# Get best
best = explorer.get_best_approach()
print(f"Winner: {best.approach_type.value}")
print(f"Fitness: {best.task_success_rate:.1%}")
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python demos/agi_lab_demo.py
```

Output shows:
- 20 approaches training in parallel
- Performance metrics for each
- Best performers selected
- Cross-pollination for next generation
- Final winner with detailed analysis

## üéì Adding New AGI Approaches

Want to test your own AGI theory? Implement `BaseAGIApproach`:

```python
from agi_lab.approaches.base import BaseAGIApproach
from agi_lab.schemas import AGIApproachType, AGIFitnessMetrics

class MyAGIApproach(BaseAGIApproach):
    def __init__(self, config=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(AGIApproachType.MY_APPROACH, config, **kwargs)

    def train(self, tasks):
        # Learn from tasks
        self.record_pattern(
            pattern_type="my_pattern",
            context="learning",
            data={"weights": [...]},
            success_score=0.85
        )

    def evaluate(self, test_tasks):
        # Measure performance
        return AGIFitnessMetrics(
            general_reasoning=0.80,
            transfer_learning=0.75,
            # ... 7 other metrics
        )

    def transfer(self, new_domain, tasks):
        # Test generalization
        return improvement_score
```

Then register in `ParallelExplorer` and you're done!

## üåü Why This Matters

### The AGI Problem
- Nobody knows the right architecture for AGI
- Hundreds of competing theories
- No objective way to compare them
- Researchers pick one approach and hope

### The AGI Lab Solution
- **Systematic exploration** of the AGI design space
- **Objective comparison** with standardized metrics
- **Automatic discovery** of what works
- **Combination** of complementary approaches
- **Continuous evolution** toward better solutions

**This is the scientific method for AGI research.**

## üìö Theoretical Foundation

### Why Parallel Exploration Works

**1. No Free Lunch Theorem**
No single algorithm works best for all problems. Solution: Try many algorithms in parallel.

**2. Evolutionary Computation**
Evolution found intelligence through parallel exploration + selection. We do the same for AGI architectures.

**3. Ensemble Methods**
Multiple diverse models outperform single models. AGI Lab creates ensembles of AGI approaches.

**4. Meta-Learning**
Learning across tasks reveals general principles. AGI Lab learns across AGI approaches.

**5. Brain Architecture**
Brains try multiple solutions in parallel (motor cortex, planning). AGI Lab mimics this.

### AGI as Optimization Problem

```
Find: AGI architecture A
Maximize: AGI_fitness(A)
Subject to: Limited compute, interpretability, safety

Search space: 10^100+ possible architectures
Method: Parallel exploration + evolutionary selection
```

The AGI Lab is a meta-optimizer for AGI architectures.

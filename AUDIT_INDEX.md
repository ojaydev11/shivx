## How Completeness Was Assessed

### Criteria:
1. **Code Presence**: Is the component implemented?
2. **Functionality**: Does it work end-to-end?
3. **Algorithm Detail**: Are algorithms fully specified?
4. **Testing**: Are there tests?
5. **Integration**: Does it integrate with other systems?
6. **Documentation**: Is it documented?
7. **Production Ready**: Can it be deployed?

### Scoring:
- **70-100%**: Production-ready, well-tested, complete algorithms
- **40-70%**: Framework present, some implementations, needs work
- **1-40%**: Skeleton or partial framework
- **0%**: Not implemented or not found

---

## Next Actions

### For Development Team:
1. **Prioritize gaps**: Start with Intent Router (critical blocker)
2. **Improve testing**: Focus on reasoning systems
3. **Add memory**: Implement vector database and RAG
4. **Specialize agents**: Move beyond debate roles
5. **Integration testing**: Verify component interactions

### For Stakeholders:
1. **Current state**: System is 45% complete overall
2. **Timeline**: 3-6 months to reach 80% with focused effort
3. **Critical gaps**: Intent routing and memory systems are bottlenecks
4. **Risk factors**: Most reasoning systems are untested
5. **Recommendation**: Prioritize intent routing and RAG

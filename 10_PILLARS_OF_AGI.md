### ShivX Integration

The complete AGI will be accessible through a unified interface:

```python
from shivx import AGI

# Initialize complete AGI
agi = AGI()

# Use any pillar
agi.reason("How can I optimize this code?")
agi.plan(goal="Build a web scraper", constraints=["fast", "reliable"])
agi.understand_language("What's the weather like?")
agi.remember("User prefers Python over JavaScript")
agi.create("Generate a novel algorithm for sorting")

# Multi-pillar integration
agi.solve_problem(
    description="Build an autonomous agent",
    use_pillars=["reasoning", "planning", "learning", "language"]
)
```

## Key Capabilities Implemented

### 1. Theory of Mind

**Core Classes:**
- `TheoryOfMind`: Main engine for mental modeling
- `AgentModel`: Representation of another agent's mental state
- `MentalState`: Tracks beliefs, intentions, goals, emotions
- `Belief`: Different belief types (factual, causal, normative, etc.)
- `Intention`: Goal and behavioral intentions

**Features:**
- âœ… Register and track multiple agents
- âœ… Observe behaviors and infer intentions
- âœ… Predict future behaviors based on mental models
- âœ… Take another agent's perspective
- âœ… Detect false beliefs (beliefs differing from reality)
- âœ… Update mental models from communication
- âœ… Track trust levels and agent reliability

**Example Usage:**
```python
tom = TheoryOfMind()
agent = tom.register_agent("alice", "Alice", capabilities={"vision", "communication"})
intention = tom.observe_behavior("alice", "Move toward door", {"target": "door"})
predictions = tom.predict_behavior("alice", {"location": "near door"})
perspective = tom.take_perspective("alice", "Door is locked")
```

### 2. Social Reasoning

**Core Classes:**
- `SocialReasoner`: Main reasoning engine
- `SocialNorm`: Represents social rules (moral, conventional, cultural)
- `SocialContext`: Situation with participants, roles, and norms
- `Intent`: Recognized intent from behavior
- `Behavior`: Observed or predicted social behavior

**Features:**
- âœ… 8 universal social norms pre-loaded
- âœ… Learn new norms from observation
- âœ… Recognize intent from behavior patterns
- âœ… Assess social appropriateness (0-1 scale)
- âœ… Predict social outcomes of actions
- âœ… Track norm violations
- âœ… Context-aware norm application

**Example Usage:**
```python
reasoner = SocialReasoner()
context = reasoner.create_context("Team meeting", ["alice", "bob", "charlie"], formality=0.7)
intents = reasoner.recognize_intent("Alice helps Bob", "alice", context)
score, reasons = reasoner.assess_appropriateness("Bob interrupts", context)
outcome = reasoner.predict_social_outcome("Share resources", "alice", context)
```

### 3. Collaboration Engine

**Core Classes:**
- `CollaborationEngine`: Main coordination engine
- `CollaborativeTask`: Multi-agent task with roles and resources
- `CommunicationStrategy`: Strategic message planning
- `ConflictResolution`: Conflict handling
- `SharedResource`: Resource allocation system

**Features:**
- âœ… Create and decompose collaborative tasks
- âœ… Three decomposition strategies (balanced, specialized, parallel)
- âœ… Strategic communication planning
- âœ… Message sending and response handling
- âœ… Resource allocation and management
- âœ… Conflict detection (resource, goal, method, priority)
- âœ… Five resolution strategies (compromise, collaboration, etc.)
- âœ… Task coordination and progress tracking
- âœ… Agent reliability scoring

**Example Usage:**
```python
collab = CollaborationEngine()
task = collab.create_collaborative_task(
    "Build robot", 
    "Complete prototype",
    ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
)
subtasks = collab.decompose_task(task, strategy="specialized")
msg = collab.send_message("alice", "bob", CommunicationType.REQUEST, "Status?")
conflict = collab.detect_conflict("alice", "bob", {"resource": "tools"})
resolved = collab.resolve_conflict(conflict)
```

## Integration Points

### With Planning Pillar
- Collaborative task decomposition uses similar goal structures
- Subtask dependencies mirror planning dependencies
- Resource allocation integrates with planning resource management

### With Memory Pillar
- Social interactions stored as episodic memories
- Agent mental models can be persisted
- Behavior history tracking for learning

### Standalone Capabilities
- Self-contained social intelligence system
- No external dependencies beyond Python standard library
- Clean API for integration with other systems

---

## Technical Highlights

### Design Patterns
- **Dataclasses**: Clean, type-safe data structures
- **Enums**: Type-safe status and category fields
- **Composition**: Modular components that work together
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple algorithms for task decomposition, conflict resolution

### Code Quality
- âœ… Comprehensive type hints throughout
- âœ… Detailed docstrings for all classes and methods
- âœ… Production-quality error handling
- âœ… Efficient data structures (dicts, sets for lookups)
- âœ… Memory management (bounded history sizes)
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns

### Performance Considerations
- In-memory caching for fast lookups
- Bounded history to prevent memory growth
- Efficient O(1) lookups for agents, norms, resources
- Lazy loading where appropriate

## Demonstration Results

The comprehensive demo (`demo_social_intelligence.py`) successfully demonstrates:

1. **Theory of Mind**: 
   - Registered 2 agents with different capabilities
   - Inferred intentions from 2 behaviors
   - Predicted 3 likely behaviors per agent
   - Took perspective of another agent
   - Updated mental models from communication

2. **Social Reasoning**:
   - Loaded 8 universal social norms
   - Learned 1 new custom norm
   - Created social context with 3 participants
   - Recognized intents from behaviors
   - Assessed appropriateness (scores: 0.66 and 0.07)
   - Predicted social outcomes with reaction forecasts

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Created collaborative task with 3 participants
   - Decomposed into 3 specialized subtasks
   - Planned communication strategies
   - Sent and responded to 2 messages
   - Allocated resources to 3 agents
   - Detected and resolved 1 conflict (100% resolution rate)
   - Coordinated task execution with progress tracking

4. **Integrated Scenario**:
   - All three components working together seamlessly
   - Multi-agent problem-solving with social awareness
   - Communication updating mental models
   - Social reasoning guiding collaborative behavior

## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Modeling Complex Mental States
**Solution**: Used hierarchical structure with MentalState containing beliefs, intentions, emotions, and knowledge. Each component tracks its own confidence and evidence.

### Challenge 2: Intent Recognition Without NLP
**Solution**: Implemented pattern-based intent recognition using keywords and context. Provides confidence scores based on evidence strength. Ready for NLP integration.

### Challenge 3: Social Norm Universality
**Solution**: Implemented universality score (0-1) and context matching. Norms apply based on both universality and context relevance.

### Challenge 4: Conflict Resolution Strategies
**Solution**: Implemented 5 different strategies mapped to conflict types. System selects appropriate strategy based on conflict nature.

### Challenge 5: Resource Allocation Fairness
**Solution**: Implemented SharedResource class with allocation tracking. Supports equal distribution, priority-based allocation, and turn-taking.

   - Cultural variation in mental models
   - Developmental progression of ToM abilities

3. **Game-Theoretic Reasoning**
   - Strategic interaction modeling
   - Nash equilibrium computation
   - Mechanism design for cooperation

4. **Natural Language Integration**
   - Connect with language pillar for communication
   - Pragmatic reasoning in dialogue
   - Speech act recognition

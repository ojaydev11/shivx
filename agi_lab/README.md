## AGI Lab - Parallel AGI Exploration Framework

**"Try many approaches in parallel, learn from what works, combine the best"**

A brain-inspired research platform for exploring AGI through parallel experimentation.

---

## üß† Core Concept

The path to AGI is uncertain. Instead of betting on one approach, we:

1. **Run 10-20 different AGI strategies simultaneously**
2. **Record all computational patterns** (like neural recordings)
3. **Evaluate AGI-ness** with comprehensive fitness metrics
4. **Select best performers** and combine their strategies
5. **Evolve over generations** until convergence

This mirrors how the brain explores possibilities in parallel and reinforces what works.

## üéØ AGI Approaches Currently Implemented

### 1. World Model Learner
- **Goal:** Learn predictive models of the world
- **Tests:** Causal understanding, generalization
- **Key insight:** AGI must predict consequences of actions

### 2. Meta-Learner
- **Goal:** Learn optimal learning strategies
- **Tests:** Sample efficiency, adaptation speed
- **Key insight:** AGI must learn HOW to learn

### 3. Causal Reasoner
- **Goal:** Understand cause-effect, do counterfactuals
- **Tests:** Intervention prediction, "what if" reasoning
- **Key insight:** AGI must know WHY things happen

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from agi_lab import ParallelExplorer, TaskGenerator

# Generate tasks
train_tasks = TaskGenerator.generate_world_model_tasks(20)
test_tasks = TaskGenerator.generate_meta_learning_tasks(10)
transfer_tasks = TaskGenerator.generate_transfer_tasks(15)

# Create explorer
explorer = ParallelExplorer(
    num_parallel=20,      # Run 20 approaches simultaneously
    max_workers=10,       # Use 10 CPU cores
)

# Run exploration
session = explorer.explore(
    train_tasks=train_tasks,
    test_tasks=test_tasks,
    transfer_tasks=transfer_tasks,
    max_generations=5,    # Evolve for 5 generations
)

# Get best approach
best = explorer.get_best_approach()
print(f"Best: {best.approach_type.value}")
print(f"Fitness: {best.task_success_rate:.2%}")
```

**Run the demo:**
```bash
python demos/agi_lab_demo.py
```

## üìä AGI Fitness Metrics

We evaluate AGI-ness across 9 dimensions:

| Metric | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **General Reasoning** | Solve diverse problems | 20% |
| **Transfer Learning** | Apply knowledge across domains | 20% |
| **Causal Understanding** | Know why, not just what | 15% |
| **Abstraction** | Handle concepts at multiple levels | 10% |
| **Creativity** | Generate novel solutions | 10% |
| **Metacognition** | Reason about own reasoning | 10% |
| **Sample Efficiency** | Learn from few examples | 5% |
| **Robustness** | Handle distribution shift | 5% |
| **Interpretability** | Explain decisions | 5% |

**Overall fitness = weighted sum of all metrics**

## üß¨ Neural Pattern Recording

Every computational pattern is recorded:

```python
pattern = NeuralPattern(
    approach_type="world_model",
    pattern_type="transition",  # activation, decision, prediction, error
    context="push_block_task",
    data={"state": "left", "action": "push_right", "next": "center"},
    success_score=0.9,
    generalization_score=0.7,
    novelty_score=0.5,
)

recorder.record_pattern(pattern)
```

Patterns are stored in SQLite for analysis:
- Which strategies work best?
- What patterns generalize?
- Which contexts are hardest?

---

## üî¨ Adding New AGI Approaches

Want to test a new AGI strategy? Implement `BaseAGIApproach`:

```python
from agi_lab.approaches.base import BaseAGIApproach
from agi_lab.schemas import AGIApproachType, AGIFitnessMetrics

class MyAGIApproach(BaseAGIApproach):
    def __init__(self, config=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(AGIApproachType.MY_APPROACH, config, **kwargs)
        # Initialize your approach

    def train(self, tasks: List[Dict]) -> None:
        """Train on tasks"""
        for task in tasks:
            # Your learning logic
            self.record_pattern(
                pattern_type="my_pattern",
                context="task_x",
                data={"key": "value"},
                success_score=0.8,
            )

    def evaluate(self, test_tasks: List[Dict]) -> AGIFitnessMetrics:
        """Evaluate performance"""
        # Test on tasks
        return AGIFitnessMetrics(
            overall_score=0.0,
            general_reasoning=0.85,
            transfer_learning=0.70,
            # ... other metrics
        )

    def transfer(self, new_domain: str, tasks: List[Dict]) -> float:
        """Test transfer learning"""
        # Evaluate zero-shot then few-shot
        return improvement_score
```

Then register in `parallel_explorer.py`:

```python
from .approaches.my_approach import MyAGIApproach

# In _generate_approaches()
if approach_type == AGIApproachType.MY_APPROACH:
    approach = MyAGIApproach(config=config, pattern_recorder=self.recorder)
```

# Find similar patterns
similar = recorder.get_similar_patterns(context="push_block", k=10)

# Consolidate (memory consolidation)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests:** Test each approach in isolation
2. **Integration tests:** Test parallel explorer
3. **Benchmark suite:** Standard AGI eval tasks
4. **Ablation studies:** Remove components, measure impact

## üåü Why This Matters

**Traditional AI:** Hand-craft one architecture, hope it works

**AGI Lab:** Systematically explore the space of possible AGI architectures

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Objective comparison** of AGI strategies
- ‚úÖ **Automatic discovery** of what works
- ‚úÖ **Combination** of complementary approaches
- ‚úÖ **Continuous improvement** through evolution
- ‚úÖ **Interpretable patterns** for understanding

**This is how we'll find the path to AGI** - not by guessing, but by systematic parallel exploration.
